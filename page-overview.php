	<div class="educational-philosophy">
		<p><span class="smallcaps">St. Mark’s Academy</span>, in following the model of classical education, progressively nurtures its students through the three fundamental stages of learning: <span class="italic">Grammar</span> (foundational and informational skills), <span class="italic">Logic</span> (thinking and reasoning skills), and <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> (integration and communication skills).  Our program is designed to help each child develop spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, and physically.<br><br>
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">We are committed to the following principles:</p>

		</div>

		<div class="grid-right">
			<p><span class="italic darker">Classical View of Reality</span>&mdash;Truth is objective and man is responsible to seek the Truth throughout his life.</p>

			<p><span class="italic darker">Nature of Man</span>&mdash;A human being is a physical and spiritual unity, and education must reflect that truth.</p>

			<p><span class="italic darker">Wisdom of the Ages</span>&mdash;Young scholars should be exposed to the finest minds in the history of the world and the great ideas that they discuss.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p><span class="smallcaps">We recognize</span> that the primary responsibility for the training of children belongs to parents. Interwoven through our program are strong Christian family values of moral integrity, respect for self and others, and the cooperation between school and home.  At St. Mark’s our emphasis is not only on the three R’s of <span class="italic">Reading</span>, <span class="italic">’Riting</span>, and <span class="italic">’Rithmetic</span>, but also the three R’s of <span class="italic">Respect</span> for authority, <span class="italic">Responsibility</span> before God and man, and <span class="italic">Resourcefulness</span> in the execution of assigned tasks.
